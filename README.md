## Information
ActionsAPI is a library for Spigot/Bukkit/Paper servers that allows plugins to share actions with each other, such as what should happen when a player clicks on an NPC. It exists so that each plugin developer doesn't have to implement numerous actions individually, and to offer greater configuration possibilities for users.

Support for specific actions is provided either by the plugin itself or through shared actions from other plugins. This enables a seamless integration and interaction between different plugins, enhancing the overall functionality of the server. By using ActionsAPI, server owners can use functionality from one plugin in other plugin.

ActionsAPI promotes a modular approach, making it easier for developers to add new features and for users to configure their server to their liking. This library is a valuable tool for any server owner looking to provide a dynamic and interactive experience for their players.
